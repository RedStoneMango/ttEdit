> [!WARNING]
> This project is under active development and not yet completed. Features may change and bugs may occur 

A third-party all-in-one desktop frontend for [**TTTool**](https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/), designed to allow you to create your own Tiptoi® Books and GME files easier — without having to use the command line.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is **not an official Ravensburger product** — just a community-made tool that works with the open-source [TTTool](https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/) project.  
> Ravensburger isn’t involved with or responsible for this app.  
> Use it at your own risk — I can’t take any responsibility if something goes wrong with your Tiptoi® pen, files, or other stuff while using it.
